# Counting Homogeneous Einstein Metrics

This folder contains code to reproduce the numerical results in Section 6 of link. 

Reproducing the results in Table 3 runs in a reasonable amount of time, except for the A5 column. 
Producing the solutions for this column takes about 12 hours when run on 200 threads, and storing
the solutions takes about 3GB.
